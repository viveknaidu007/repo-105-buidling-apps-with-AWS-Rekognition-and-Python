here im performing the steps build the apps works with Amazon Rekognition , python

## What is Amazon Rekognition ðŸ¤” ?
* Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that uses machine learning to analyze and recognize objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos :


## what can we do with this ?
* basically we can analyse the images . videos . we can extract the info or valuable insights from uploaded things using this rekognition.

## steps :

* Step 1: Set up an AWS account and create a User
* Step 2: Set up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs
* Step 3: Getting started using the AWS CLI and AWS SDK API
* Step 4: Getting started using the Amazon Rekognition console

## AWS :

### AMAZON S3 (simple storage service):
* Block level of storage 
* It is highly scalable , secuarable , durable
* Easy to store and retrive the data
* Object based storage and data is spread miltple regions.
* for S3 we dont need server , becauz here storage we are not doing in server , we are doing storage in specific resources thats called (bucket) , we r storing our data in buckets
* for ex : i want to store the 10 Md of data , so for that i have created bucket. and i store this 10 MD od data , so we can access this data at anytime & anywhere 
* And bucket is Globally accesible
* Max size : 5TB , Min  size : 1Kb for the bucket
* We only store in 5Gb of data in object 

### Buckets :
* If we create a root level folder then it is called as buckets
* Used ot store objects 
* we cannot delete the bucket directly , we need to make empty it first

### Object :
* files that we stored in a bucket called object
* When you put an object in bucket :
1. Key : Name of an object
2. Value : Data in bytes
3. VersionID : shows versioning

## Rules :
* Unique name
* Name should be 3 to 63 characters
* Only lowert case is valid
* Should not be in IP format

## About Rekognition :
- features:
* Labels
* Custom labels
* Text detection
* Face search and Verificatoin
* Content moderation .. etc

- Advantages:
* Easy Integration
* Use of Artificial Intelligence
* scalable Image Analysis
* Completely Integration
* Low Costs

- Use Cases:
* Make Content Searchable 
* We can Flag any inappropriate Content
* enable digital identity Verification
* Respond quickly to public safety Challenges
* Identify products , landmarks , and brands
* Analyse Shopper Patterns ... etc


## AWS Cil & SDK:
* the AWS SDK is a set of API libraries that let you integrate AWS services into your applications.


## imp steps for shot detection :

1. SQS que creation :
* u will get like this :
* https://sqs.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/381492233747/shot_detection :
* arn:aws:sqs:ap-south-1:381492233747:shot_detection

1. Setting Up and Finding Your SNS Topic ARN : arn:aws:sns:ap-south-1:381492233747:shot_detect
* https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home.
* here we can give any (any topic name) 

2. Setting Up and Finding Your IAM Role ARN  : arn:aws:iam::381492233747:role/vivek_role 
* https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
* here create role name (any name):
* and give permisioins for these : AmazonRekognitionFullAccess . AmazonS3FullAccess ,AWSLambdaExecute , S3object
